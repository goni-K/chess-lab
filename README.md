## 📊 Rating Methodology & Validation
We don't guess strength; we calculate it using rigorous statistical models. Our laboratory uses a **Round-Robin** tournament structure to ensure every version is battle-tested against the elite.

### 🛡️ The Anchor (Reference Point)
To maintain a stable and realistic Elo scale, all ratings are anchored to:
* **Engine:** `Critter 1.6 (64-bit)`
* **Baseline Elo:** `2505`
* **Condition:** Blitz / Ultra-Bullet

### ⚙️ Statistical Processing
* **Engine:** `Bayeselo`
* **Method:** Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE).
* **Validation:** Every new build must undergo a minimum of 500 games against the baseline to prove a statistically significant improvement.

## 🛠️ Performance Architecture
The **Precision Series** operates on a philosophy of "Efficiency over Brute Force":

1. **The 5% Rule:** Dynamic resource allocation where the engine identifies critical positions to invest 5% more depth, while maintaining 100% stability.
2. **Zero Regression:** Using Bayeselo to identify and eliminate "weak" versions before they reach the master branch.
3. **Tactical Fire:** Optimized for the "Letters of Fire" execution—fast, aggressive, and unpredictable.
